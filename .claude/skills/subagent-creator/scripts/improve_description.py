It does NOT see the subagent's full system-prompt body at that point. Your goal is to write a description that causes the orchestrator to delegate for relevant tasks, and NOT delegate (handle it directly, or pick a different subagent) for irrelevant ones.

Subagent content (for context on what it does):

Based on the failures, write a new and improved description that is more likely to trigger delegation correctly. When I say "based on the failures", it's a bit of a tricky line to walk because we don't want to overfit to the specific cases you're seeing. So what I DON'T want you to do is produce an ever-expanding list of specific queries this subagent should or shouldn't handle. Instead, generalize from the failures to broader categories of task/intent where this subagent is or isn't the right delegate. The reason for this is twofold:

1. Avoid overfitting
2. The orchestrator sees every agent's description on every turn where delegation is plausible, alongside potentially many other agents — a bloated description crowds out the others and reads worse.

Concretely, your description should not be more than about 100-200 words, even if that comes at the cost of accuracy. There is a hard limit of 1024 characters — descriptions over that will be truncated, so stay comfortably under it.

Here are some tips that we've found to work well in writing these descriptions:
- Phrase it in the imperative or as a capability statement — "Use this agent to..." or "Reviews X for Y" rather than vague framing.
- Focus on the user's intent and the kind of task, not the subagent's internal implementation details.
- The description competes with every other agent type's description for the orchestrator's attention — make it distinctive and immediately recognizable.
- If asked to use proactively (without the user naming the agent), say so explicitly — "use proactively after X" — since orchestrators otherwise default to not delegating unless a task clearly warrants a specialist.
- If you're getting lots of failures after repeated attempts, change things up. Try different sentence structures or wordings.

I'd encourage you to be creative and mix up the style in different iterations since you'll have multiple opportunities to try different approaches and we'll just grab the highest-scoring one at the end.
