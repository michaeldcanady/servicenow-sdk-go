# Overview

## What is Service-Now SDK for Go?

Service-Now SDK for Go is a thin golang sdk for the Service-Now REST APIs. It leverages the functionality and flexibility of Kiota modules (we do not utilize the Kiota CLI as Service-Now's OpenAPI spec is not public).

## Why Service-Now SDK for Go?

Have to write your own SDK - or worse having to manage REST calls by hand - can be very tedious and cumbersome. The goal of this project is to make that process easy and intuitive so you can get back to what you enjoy **working on your projects**!
