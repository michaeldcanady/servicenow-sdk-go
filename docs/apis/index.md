# Overview

This section provides implementation guidance for each supported API in the SDK. Each SDK submodule corresponds to a Service-Now REST API of the same name. For example, the `table-api` submodule wraps the Table REST API.

To ensure clarity and maintainability:

- **Internal consistency** within each submodule takes precedence.
- **Cross-module consistency** remains a broader goal (but may vary for specific reasons).

Each subsection includes examples and usage patterns tailored to the specific API it supports.
