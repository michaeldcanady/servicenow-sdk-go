## What's Service-Now SDK for Go?

Service-Now SDK for Go is a thin golang sdk for the Service-Now REST apis. It leverages the functionality and flexibility of Kiota modules (we don't use the Kiota CLI as Service-Now's OpenAPI spec, if it exists at all, isn't public).

## Why Service-Now SDK for Go?

Have to write your own SDK - or worse having to manage REST calls by hand - can be tedious and cumbersome. The goal of this project is to make that process easy and intuitive so you can get back to what you enjoy **working on your projects**!
