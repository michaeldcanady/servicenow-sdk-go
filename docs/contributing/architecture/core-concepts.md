# Core Concepts

## RequestBuilder Facade
At the heart of the SDK is the `RequestBuilder`, which acts as a high-level interface for constructing and executing HTTP operations for a specific API path. A `RequestBuilder` is added at each path diversion. (I.E.: https://{host}/api, is shared between **all** APIs so it‚Äôs superfluous to include).
Example:
The path `‚Ä¶/api/now/{version}/table`  becomes two `requestBuilders`
- `NowRequestBuilder`
- `TableRequestBuilder`
> Note: Version doesn‚Äôt get a `RequestBuilder` as the *whole* SDK represents a single version of the API.
## üõ†Ô∏è RequestBuilder Structure
Every RequestBuilder exposes methods aligned with supported HTTP operations, accepting standardized parameters or a method to build the next path segment. 
These methods wrap internal logic for:
1. Building the request: Dynamically constructs the HTTP request, including headers, query parameters, and payload.
2. Sending the request: Routes the request via a pluggable HTTP client, enabling retries, logging, etc.
3. Handling the response: Maps raw HTTP responses into structured SDK types or error classes.
## üì¶ Batch API Compatibility
All `RequestBuilder` types support batch operations via a shared convention:
`ToXXXRequestInformation(‚Ä¶) (RequestInformation, error)` methods.
These methods generate  lightweight RequestInformation object which encapsulate:
* The HTTP method
* Target URL
* Headers and query parameters
* Request body (if applicable)
This makes batch execution possible without sending the request immediately, enabling deferred or grouped interactions.
